I guess a nice welcome message on the homepage would be nice:

We're looking forward to seeing you at the Dictyostelium International Conference 2015 at the Royal Holloway. Conveniently located only 8 miles from London International airport Heathrow.
More information on the program and the opening of registration is expected early 2015.

Robin Williams,
Arjan Kortholt and
Douwe Veltman


There is some nice travel information on the Royal Holloway Conference Website too (http://www.conferences.rhul.ac.uk/index.asp). I guess a tab on the Dictybase website with a copy of this information will be helpful:

Public Transport
By Train

The nearest train station is Egham, approximately 1 mile from Royal Holloway. It has direct links to London Waterloo, Ascot, Reading and Weybridge.
By Bus

Buses from Windsor, Slough and Heathrow Airport stop just outside the College gates.
By Plane

London Heathrow Airport is only 8 miles away 
 Plan Your Journey

To plan your journey via public transport you can use the Travel Line service which provides details of train, bus and coach services:

If youâ€™re journey will only involve train travel then please use the National Rail Enquiries which provides details of train times and ticket prices:

The nearest train station is Egham, approximately 1 mile from Royal Holloway. It has direct links to London Waterloo, Ascot, Reading and Weybridge. Visit www.nationalrail.co.uk 

Royal Holloway is well served by local bus services to all London Heathrow terminals, Egham, Staines, Windsor and beyond. Nearby Egham offers regular train connections to Reading, Guildford and central London. Buses and trains are often an easier, faster way of getting around the local area, particularly during peak hours.



The conference facility also has a registration / payment collection facility via a secure website and we are thinking about using this. I guess this could be done via an external link on the registration tab? They do not have an abstract submission option, so that would then need to be done via Dictybase. They accept credit cards, but not American Express. Would that be a problem for US participants?
